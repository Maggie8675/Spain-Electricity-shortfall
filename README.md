# Spain Electricity shortfall - Predicting Daily Shortfall using Machine Learning(AI)

## Context
The Spanish Government is contemplating additional investments in renewable energy and seeks comprehensive data on the current trends in both renewable and non-renewable energy generation in Spain. Their goal is to develop the capability to forecast potential energy supply deficits for any given day, taking into account various factors like wind speed, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and more. This supply deficit, often referred to as "load shortfall," is the variation between renewable and non-renewable energy generation.

## Expected Outcomes
- Recognize trends and patterns in energy generation.
- Construct a regression model for load shortfall prediction.
- Deliver a presentation on the findings.

## Tools Employed 

- Python
  - SKLearn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- Flask
- AWS EC2
